# Stock Analysis Refactored

## **Overview of Project:** 
Refactoring our stock analysis code to run through all stocks in our dataset.

## **Purpose:**
To determine if refactoring our code loop through the stock data will make it run faster. In addition, what advantage & disadvantages may happen through refactoring the code. 

# **Results:**

**Graphics for Run Times on the Refactored VBA code**

# Summary:
**1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?**

**Advantages:** 
- Improves the design look of the code, making it easier to understand.
- Makes it easier to find and trouble shoot errors.
- Often makes the code run faster.

**Disadvantages:**
- Cleaning up code can be extremely time consuming, and when possible, should be done in small steps and tested. 
- Could drive costs of a project up due to the amount of time needed to make changes.
- Changes could effect the testing outcomes.

**2.  How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?**

When refactoring the orginal VBA script, it took almost twice as long as it did it did to write the codes originally.  However, once all codes were cleaned up, errors were easier to spot and correct.  The functionality remained the same, however, the code had fewer steps, there by using less memory and improve understanding for future analysis to use.
